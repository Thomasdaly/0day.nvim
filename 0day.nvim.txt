Neovim Plugin for Pen Testers and Bug Bounty Hunters: Feature and Workflow Overview
Core Features

    Markdown-Based Note-Taking and File Generation

        Tagging System:
            Use specific tags in markdown files to differentiate between notes and content meant for file generation.
            Tags:
                @note: for regular notes.
                @generate: for content that should be converted into .txt files.

        Automatic File Generation:
            The plugin scans the markdown file for @generate: tags, extracts the content, and creates corresponding .txt files.
            Generated files are named systematically, e.g., output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt.

    Key Mapping for Recent File Management
        Open the Most Recent File:
            A keymap (e.g., <leader>rf) opens the most recently created or modified file in a new split pane within Neovim.
        Process Completion Notifications:
            After running a command or generating a file, the plugin notifies the user with a message like "Process Complete: output.txt created."
        Handling Multiple Processes:
            Users can open specific recent files related to different processes using an identifier (e.g., :OpenRecentFile [process_id]).

    CLI Tool Template Management
        Template Definition:
            Define templates for various CLI tools in YAML or Lua, specifying command structure, input placeholders, and output management.
        Automatic Output File Management:
            Each template can include an "output" field with dynamic naming (e.g., using timestamps) to ensure outputs are well-organized and traceable.
        Integrated Tool Execution:
            Run CLI tools directly from Neovim using the template, with automatic management of input files and output generation.

    Custom Workflows and Automation
        Always-On Output Tags:
            Templates can include always-on output tags, ensuring every command run via the plugin has its output saved and managed automatically.
        Interactive File and Process Management:
            Commands like :RunTool and :OpenRecentFile streamline the process of running tools and managing their outputs within the editor.
        File Tracking and Management:
            The plugin tracks recently generated files and allows easy access through key mappings and commands.

Example Workflows

    Reconnaissance Phase with Markdown Notes and File Generation
        The pen tester creates a markdown file with notes and @generate: tags to define lists of IPs, domains, etc.
        Running a command like :GenerateFiles my_recon_notes.md generates necessary .txt files (e.g., ips.txt, domains.txt).
        These files are then used as input for tools like nmap, gobuster, etc.

    Running a Tool and Managing Outputs
        The tester runs a tool using a predefined template, e.g., :RunTool nmap ips.txt -p80.
        The plugin automatically manages the command execution, saving the output to a file (e.g., nmap_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt).
        Upon completion, the plugin notifies the tester, and they can immediately open the file using <leader>rf.

    Template-Driven Automation
        A tester prepares templates for commonly used tools like nmap, gobuster, and sqlmap.
        Each template defines the command structure and where the output should go.
        By simply running :RunTool tool_name input_file options, the tester can execute complex commands with consistent output management.

    Reviewing Outputs from Multiple Processes
        The tester runs multiple processes concurrently.
        Each process's output is tracked, and the tester can open the most recent one with <leader>rf or cycle through them with :OpenRecentFile [process_id].

Additional Ideas for Future Expansion

    Improved Parsing and Error Handling
        Implement more sophisticated parsing of markdown files, including error handling for missing tags or improperly formatted lines.
        Consider adding support for more complex content within @generate: tags, such as conditionals or loops.

    Interactive File Selection
        Integrate with tools like Telescope for fuzzy searching through generated files, making it easier to find and open specific outputs.
        Allow users to tag files with metadata or notes for easier retrieval.

    Integration with External Tools
        Consider integrating the plugin with external tools like Zap or Burp Suite for more advanced automation.
        Implement features to fetch and parse results from these tools, feeding them back into the workflow.

    Advanced Output Management
        Add options for automatic PDF generation from markdown files, including formatted notes and output summaries.
        Implement a mechanism to auto-archive outputs after a testing session, organizing them by project or date.

    Customization and User Configuration
        Allow users to customize key mappings, template locations, and output file naming conventions.
        Add support for user-defined tags beyond @note: and @generate:, enabling more flexible workflows.
